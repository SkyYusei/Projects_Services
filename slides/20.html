    <h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>Recall in previous projects in this course, you provisioned instances and set up various database systems yourself, and,
	in the last few projects, implemented fairly sophisticated protocols in order to manage data that is distributed across multiple
	data stores. Many of the tasks involved in designing, configuring and managing these databases are non-trivial. In fact, in the 
	traditional IT model where software and resources are owned by individual organizations, multiple full-time personnel are hired
	simply to configure, monitor and maintain database systems, known as database administrators or (DBAs).</p>
	
	<p>There are multiple tasks involved in keeping a database within operational parameters for an application. The DB must be monitored 
	periodically to ensure that query performance is within the expected range of the application. Data in the DB must be periodically backed-up
	or snap-shotted to recover in case of failure events.</p>
	
	<p>An important value-added service that many cloud services offer is the ability to "outsource" or shift the responsibility of running and maintaining
	a database systems away from the user and to the cloud provider. In the cloud computing industry, these type of services have been typically referred to as
	Database-as-a-Service or (DBaaS).</p>
	
	
    <h3>Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)</h3>

    <p>Database-as-a-Service are a managed database services offered by cloud providers. In DBaaS, cloud providers offer packaged database services which
	users can configure and deploy, while the cloud provider performs the traditional database administration
        functions. The database can seamlessly scale and is maintained, upgraded and backed-up by the cloud provider.
        DBaaSes also provide better monitoring failure resiliency than typical off-the-shelf database installations, and can hence improve application availability
and manageability. DBaaSes can typically handle many of the routine tasks that typically require full-time DBAs.</p>

    <p>In this module we will introduce you to AWS' Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings. These services enable users to rapidly
        configure and deploy a database system without having to manually launch instances and configure database
        software. You will learn about a NoSQL database service provided by AWS (Amazon's DynamoDB).
        In addition, you will continue to use MySQL on EC2 and HBase on EMR.</p>

    <h3>Social Networking Application Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>Social networking applications such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram provide people with a method to virtually
        connect to others, share their life with others and see what others are up to. Today, billions of people across the world use these applications. As you can imagine, these services require complex and well designed back-end systems to handle the various types of user data, provide consistently fast performance and low latency, and use cutting-edge analytics to derive information that is valuable to these companies and advertisers, in near-real time. In this project, we will walk you through a process to help you build your own social network!</p>

<p>The following (Figure 1) shows a page from a social networking application, Facebook, in case you are fortunate enough to have never seen it:</p>

    <div class="img-thumbnail">
        <img src="https://cmucc-public.s3.amazonaws.com/p34/figures/1-sns-demo.png" width=600/>
        <h4>
            <small class="caption"><b>Figure 1</b>: A screenshot of a social network website (Facebook) belonging to your competitor (keep reading)</small>
        </h4>
    </div>
<p></p>
    <p>Most social networks have to deal with various types of data. For instance, each post you make on Facebook may
        contain text,
        links, images, videos and/or any combination of them. In addition, users access content about themselves and their connections that is dynamically generated and personalized for each user.
		Consider the timeline view that is shown in Figure 1. A single HTTP request to retrieve and display a page in a social network may trigger a
        large number of subsequent requests and database actions at the back-end. In most cases, it does not make sense for different types of media to be
        stored and retrieved in the same manner. In this module, you will build a social network application that
        retrieves different types of media from different back-end systems.</p>

    <p>Apart from having to deal with a complex web service architecture, web-scale applications also suffer from a huge
        work amplification. Think about a single google search query:</p>
    
	<blockquote><p>When you enter a single query in the Google search box, or just speak it to your phone, you set in
        motion as much computing as it took to send Neil Armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon. Not just the
        actual flights, but all the computing done throughout the planning and execution of the 11-year, 17 mission
        Apollo program.</p>
		<footer>Udi Manber and Peter Norvig, Google</footer>
		</blockquote>

    <p>Most requests made to the front-end of a social network application trigger requests to many internal back-end
        services to retrieve fresh information, serve valid advertisements, forward data to the MSB, etc. Here is an
        example of a typical fan-out graph for a small user-generated request to
        <a href="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/nishtala_nsdi13_slides.pdf">Facebook</a>.
        Every leaf node (lowest tier) in the graph represents a single computation, whereas non-leaf nodes indicate
        aggregation and additional computation. Often a single database cannot handle all of these queries, leading to
        distributed back-ends that employ replication and sharding to serve data effectively.</p>

    <h3>Architectural Overview</h3>

    <p>Generally speaking, a modern social networking site at least needs to store and process 3 kinds of data - user profiles,
        user activities, and a big data analytics system.</p>


    <ol>
        <li>User Profiles
            <ol type="a">
                <li>User Authentication System (such as a Single-Sign-On or SSO)</li>
                <li>User Info / Profile</li>
                <li>Action Log</li>
                <li>Social Graph of the User: follower, followee, family etc.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>User Activity System - All user generated media</li>
        <li>Big Data Analytics System
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Search System</li>
                <li>Recommender System</li>
                <li>User Behaviour Analysis</li>
            </ol>

    <h1 class="page-header">The Scenario: Build Your Own Social Website</h1>

    <p>Three weeks after you started to work on the database systems at Carnegie Records, the company (coincidentally?) started facing
        financial issues. Unfortunately, to cut a long story short, you ended up getting fired. Now, with only $15 in your pocket, you decide to launch your own startup. Your mom is willing to lend you $15 more for a 10% stake in your company, but you are trying to avoid that. And if you need more than $30, you will need to borrow from the Pinklepuss twins, who will probably take over your company and hold on to all your profits.</p>
    <p>The first product of your new company is a social networking website called CinemaChat, where people discuss their favorite movies. Your first task is to build a timeline to display posts and comments. Since the only resource you own is your laptop, which you cannot leave connected to the Internet all the time, you decide to build the website on AWS. </p>
    <p>Your friends at TPZ Inc. help you build a simple web front-end in return for a candy bar, so you are only responsible for implementing the back-end. With no data source, the front-end looks like this:</p>

            </h4>
        </div>
    </center>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        You need to load four different datasets into three different kinds of databases (MySQL, HBase, DynamoDB)
        and query the heterogeneous database system for correct answers which will be returned in JSON format
        according to the HTTP
        requests received. All
        datasets are
        provided in CSV (comma-separated values) format and you need to design your own schema for all the
        databases. Your Back-end Instance (BI) should be able to deal with in total <b>four</b> kinds of queries <b>simultaneously</b>
        and the Front-end Instance (FI) is only used to display the result. All of your work should be done on BI only.
    </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
        <h4 id="warnings">Warnings</h4>

        <p>1. Some of the services you will be using for this project, such as DynamoDB and EMR, are expensive when
            left running or configured incorrectly. Please plan ahead and pay special attention to the instructions
            before provisioning any
            resources.</p>

        <p>2. You should store the datasets in back-end system listed in the AWS Details table. You may use any number
            of tables, but use the correct system for each item of data.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Setting up a Front-end Instance</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Launch one Front-end Instance (FI) of type <code>m3.large</code> or <code>m3.xlarge</code> and set its
            security groups to allow <code>all traffic</code>.
        </li>
        <li>SSH to the FI and run the following shell script to start the service:
            <pre>/home/ubuntu/wildfly-8.2.0.Final/bin/standalone.sh</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Go to <code>http://frontend-public-dns:8080/p3-3.4/index.html</code> in your browser and if you can see
            the following page, your FI is correctly launched. The launch process may take up to 5 minutes.
        </li>
            <div class="img-thumbnail">

            </div>
        <p></p>
    </ol>

    <h3>Setting up a Back-end Instance</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Launch one Back-end Instance (BI) of type <code>m3.large</code> and set its security groups to allow <code>all
            traffic</code>. All tour work will be done on
            BI. The FI is only used for rendering and displaying your response.</p>
        </li>
        <li>SSH into the server instance using <b>ubuntu</b> as the user name and navigate to <b>Project3_4</b> folder
            in
            your home directory. We use <a href="https://maven.apache.org/run.html">Apache Maven 3</a> to manage build,
            reporting and documentation of this project due to the complex dependency relations.
        </li>
        <li>You can find the project object model (POM) file <a
                href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html">pom.xml</a> which
            contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. All the
            necessary libraries are already included in
            pom.xml. If you do not want to add some extra dependencies, you do not need to worry about pom.xml.
        </li>
        <li>You can find five .java files under
            <code>/home/ubuntu/Project3_4/src/main/java/cc/cmu/edu/minisite/</code>
            directory. Your task is to complete <b>four</b> Java Servlet files: <b>ProfileServlet.java (task 1)</b>,
            <b>FollowerServlet.java (task2)</b>,
            <b>HomepageServlet.java (task 3)</b>, and <b>TimelineServlet.java (task 4)</b>. Some starter code is
            provided in
            each of these files. You can also find another file called <b>MiniSite.java</b> which is the
            server for this project. All the deployments of Servlets are written in this file and you should
            <b>NOT</b> change anything in <b>MiniSite.java</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can also find the executable <b>submitter</b> and
            <b>references</b> file under the same directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            To build the project, run the following command under
            <code>/home/ubuntu/Project3_4</code> directory:
            <pre> mvn clean package</pre>
            Then launch your server with the following command:
            <pre>mvn exec:java</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Go to
            <code>http://frontend-public-dns:8080/p3-3.4/index.html?id=2&pwd=oltaa&task=1&dns=backend-public-dns</code>
            in your browser and verify that you can see the default response:

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
        <h4>Notes on Java Servlet</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Each of the given <code>xxxServlet.java</code> is dedicated for one specific task.</li>
            <li>Within each Servlet file, there is a method called <code>doGet</code> which you will need to implement
                in order to complete this project.
            </li>
            <li>Inside each <code>doGet</code>method, you will need to parse the request, connect to your backend
                database,
                send queries, parse the result returned and send a response back to the client.
            </li>
            <li>A basic demo of how to process <code>request</code> and <code>response</code> in Servlet is given in
                each file.
            </li>
            <li>You may want to initialize your database connection in the constructor of each Servlet.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The starter codes are using <code>org.json</code> package to deal with JSON, you can read more
                    about it <a href="http://www.json.org/java/">here</a>. You can feel free to use any other JSON
                    libraries you like such as <code>google/gson</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Reading data from each database will be used in multiple tasks, therefore you need to design your
                program carefully so that it's reusable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adding a new dependency to the project is easy in a Maven project. You just need to follow a few
                    steps:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Search for the dependency required from <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/">Maven
                        Repository</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the contents between
                        &lt;dependency&gt; tag into pom.xml between
                            &lt;dependencies&gt;.

            This query simulates the login process of a user, and tests whether your backend system is
            functioning properly.
            Your web application will receive a pair of <b>UserID</b> and <b>Password</b>, and you need to check in your
            backend database to see if the UserID and Password is a valid pair. You should construct your response
            accordingly:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>If <b>YES</b>, send back the user's <b>Name</b> and <b>Profile Image URL</b>.</li>
                <li>If <b>NOT</b>,
                    set <b>Name</b> as "Unauthorized" and <b>Profile Image URL</b> as "#".
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>To finish this task, you need to make use of two of the datasets provided - <b>Login Information</b>
            and <b>User Profile</b></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The format that your web application running on <b>Backend Instance</b> will receive is as follows:</p>

    <p>Request Format:
    <pre>GET /task1?id=[UserID]&pwd=[Password]</pre>
    </p>

    <p>Your web application's response should be a JSON object, the format is given below:</p>
    <p>Response Format:
    <pre>{"name":"my_name", "profile":"profile_image_url"}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>In order to save you some hassle, here is some sample code to create the JSON response:
<pre>
JSONObject result = new JSONObject();
result.put("name", "my_name");
result.put("profile", "profile_image_url");
PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();
writer.write(String.format("returnRes(%s)", result.toString()));
writer.close();</pre>
    </p>

    <p>A sample request that your web application will receive looks like this:
    <pre>http://backend-public-dns:8080/MiniSite/task1?id=3&pwd=cvrdakraa</pre>
    </p>
    <p>The expected response that your web application should construct and return look like this:
    <pre>returnRes({"name":"Aalto","profile":"https://cmucloudsocial.s3.amazonaws.com/profiles/e8a7e982144ee3078f432d0d0b105a.png"})</pre>
    </p>
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
        <h4 id="warnings">Notes</h4>

        <p>
            You may notice the returnRes() outside of the JSON file. This is used as a callback function for the
            frontend to make a cross-domain HTTP request. You can ignore it and pay attention to the correctness of the
            JSON
            inside of it only.
        </p>
    </div>

    <br/>
    <h4>Test Task1 with your FI</h4>

    <p>After completing your tasks in your BI, you can visualize and test the results using your Frontend Instance.</p>

    <p>You need to add the public dns of BI to the request parameter the first time you send the query. This helps
        connect your BI with FI. If you find you BI being unable to correctly receive request from your FI, try to include BI
        dns in your request to FI again. You need to add a task parameter in your request to FI too.
    </p>

    <p>Sample Request:
    <pre>http://frontend-public-dns:8080/p3-3.4/index.html?id=2&pwd=oltaa&dns=backend-public-dns&task=1</pre>

        and
        profile image):

    <h1 class="page-header">Task2: Storing Social Graph using HBase</h1>

    <p>To build a social networking site, apart from the user information, you also need to store the relations between
        users. This is done using a social graph, a data structure that represents the relations between users.</p>

    <h4>HBase</h4>
    <p>Google's original use case for BigTable was the storage and processing for web graph information, represented as
        sparse matrices. Thus HBase is naturally suitable for storing a social graph. It's massively scalable, well-suited to
        the graphical data model, and supports multi-hop querying. As HBase is a column-based database, it provides good
        performance on graph analysis. You may also want to check out the graph databases built on top of
        HBase, such as <a href="http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/">TitanDB</a>, which provide more scalable
        solutions and can support thousands of concurrent users executing complex graph traversals in real time.</p>

            This query asks for the followers of a given user.
            Your web application will receive a single <code>UserID</code> as request parameter,
            and you need to send back the <code>Name</code> and <code>Profile Image URL</code> of his/her
            <b>Followers</b> .
        </li>
        <li>
            You should sort the followers <b>alphabetically</b> in <b>ascending</b> order by

                HBase and Hadoop libraries are already installed on the project's Backend Instance.
            </li>
            <li>To connect HBase, you may want to import, but not restricted to, the following libraries:
            <pre>
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseConfiguration;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Get;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Result;

import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HConnectionManager;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                You can set up the HBase cluster in the same subnet with the BI and use the private ip address of master

    <h1 class="page-header">Task3: Build Homepage using DynamoDB</h1>

    <p>Amazon's DynamoDB is a NoSQL distributed database, similar to HBase and Cassandra. You have already implemented
        your
        own distributed datastore with <b>eventual consistency</b> in the previous project. DynamoDB is one of
        best-known
        examples of a database using eventual consistency (it however also supports strong consistency).</p>

    <p>As an application developer using DynamoDB, your only concern is how
        much read and write throughput your application needs - you do not have to worry about scaling, tuning,
        replication, etc. DynamoDB takes care of the scaling requirements for you.</p>

    <p>DynamoDB supports both document and key-value store models. Its flexible data model and reliable performance make
        it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad-tech, IoT, and many other applications.
    </p>

    <h4>Key-value Store</h4>

    <p>A key-value store provides the simplest possible data model and is exactly what the name suggests: it's a storage
        system that stores values indexed by a key. You're limited to query by key and the values are opaque, i.e., the store
        doesn't know anything about them. This allows very fast read and write operations (a simple disk access) and you can imagine this
        model as a kind of non volatile cache (i.e. well suited if you need fast accesses by key to long-lived
        data).
    </p>

    <h4>Document Store</h4>

    <p>A document-oriented database extends the previous model. Values are stored in a structured format (a document
        ) that the database can understand. This is different from traditional RDBS though since the format can be extended
        or truncated at will. For example, a document could be a blog post and the comments
        and the tags stored in a denormalized way. Since the data is structured by fields, the store can do more work (like
        indexing fields of the document) and you're not limited to query by key. Such databases allow fetching the data for an entire page
        with a single query and are well suited for content oriented applications (which is why big sites like Facebook or Amazon like them).
    </p>

    <h4>DynamoDB Data Model</h4>

    <p>
        The DynamoDB data model concepts include tables, items and attributes.
        In Amazon DynamoDB, a database is a collection of tables. A table is a collection of items and each item is a
        collection of attributes.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Tables</b>

            <p>
                DynamoDB only requires that a table has a primary key, but does not require you to define all of the
                attribute names and data types in advance.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Items</b>

            <p>Individual items in a DynamoDB table can have any number of
                attributes, although there is a limit of 400 KB on the item size. An item size is the sum of lengths of
                its attribute names and values (binary and UTF-8 lengths).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Attributes</b>

            <p>Each attribute in an item is a name-value pair. An attribute can be single-valued or multi-valued set.
                For example, a book item can have title and authors attributes. Each book has one title but can have
                many authors. The multi-valued attribute is a set; duplicate values are not allowed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Primary Key</b>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Simple Primary Key
                    <p>The primary key is made of one attribute, a <b>hash attribute</b>. DynamoDB builds an <b>unordered</b>
                        hash
                        index on this primary key attribute. Each item in the table is uniquely identified by its hash
                        key value.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Composite Primary Key
                    <p>The primary key is made of two attributes. The first attribute is the <b>hash attribute</b> and
                        the
                        second one is the <b>range attribute</b>. DynamoDB builds an <b>unordered</b> hash index on the
                        hash primary
                        key attribute, and a <b>sorted</b> range index on the range primary key attribute. Each item in
                        the
                        table is uniquely identified by the combination of its hash and range attribute values. It is
                        possible for two items to have the same hash attribute value, but those two items must have
                        different range attribute values.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br/>

    <p>In task 3, you will need to build a database system to store all the posts of the social network using DynamoDB. The raw data is provided in
        JSON format where each post is represented by a complex nested JSON Object. Therefore, you need to choose an
        appropriate hash key (and probably an appropriate range key too) to store the posts so that
        when we query your server with a user's id, you should be able to show us all of the posts for that user.

        <h4>Setting up DynamoDB</h4>
        Before proceeding make sure you understand how <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/">cost</a> is calculated
        for DynamoDB, since this can be quite expensive and you may burn through your entire budget very quickly.
        <ol>
            <li>In AWS, choose DynamoDB service from console and create a new DynamoDB table</li>
            <li>Choose primary key type and assign to appropriate attributes</li>
            <li>You can skip the <b>Add Index</b> page by click <b>Continue</b></li>
            <li>Set the Read and Write capacities according to your need. E.g. If you are about to load data, it will be
                good to set the write capacity to 500 unit. You can also monitor read/write capacity from the <b>Monitoring</b>
                tab.
            </li>
            <li>After successfully creating a DynamoDB table, you should be able to view it in the console after a few
                minutes.
            </li>

                    stored in a
                    different format other than CSV/TSV files, so first you need to convert the data into the correct
                    format for DynamoDB. You can find a detailed description on DyanmoDB data format <a
                            href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-importexport-ddb-pipelinejson-verifydata2.html">here</a>

Magalis bikes to her job as a nurse and attracts all the wrong sort of men-- an aging carpenter who's hopelessly in love with her, a no-good cheater, and a rich Italian, but her real challenge is the fight between her dictatorial father and her gay brother. When Maria dies in childbirth her husband Santos flees, leaving the grandmother to raise the boy and to salvage the son's image of his absent father. In the third story, the engineer Chino and his pharmacist wife Vivian suffer a miscarriage, and with it the expectations of their parents for a grandchild, both of which are aggravated by a sibling who flees with his family from Cuba. The three stories are not connected in the film, except for a common theme -- people who flee their problems then face the challenge to return for reconciliation.
